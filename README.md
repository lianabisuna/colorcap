## Technologies

- Vue.js 3 (JavaScript Framework)
- Tailwind CSS 2 (CSS Framework)
- Vuex 4 (State Management)
- Font Awesome (Icons)
- DOM to Image

## Learnings

The main purpose of creating this app is to familiarize myself with the updates of Vue.js. Sadly, there's no compatible Vuetify for the new Vue.js yet so I went with the second best, Tailwind CSS for the design.

I also learned about: 
- Difference between Composition API and Options API
- Vue.js 3 and Tailwind CSS compatibility
- Vue.js 3 and Vuex 4 compatibility
- Vuex 4 and Composition API compatibility

P.S. I had a hard time deploying it to Netlify because of some Gitlab errors so I reuploaded it with another repository in Github.

## Screenshots

This is how it looks upon clicking the link and toggling it to dark mode:
